### 🎮 2 players (mouse & keyboard)  
### 🕵️‍♂️ Hide-and-seek / Memory game  
### 🧭 Theme: **Underground Treasure Hunt**

---

## 📜 Overview

Both players find themselves trapped in an ancient **underground vault**, overflowing with priceless treasures. But beware... Among these treasures lies a **possessed artifact** that refuses to end up behind a museum glass! 👻💰

## 💡 Concept

You’ve just infiltrated a **secret Greek tomb**... but a mischievous spirit has beaten you to it and possessed one of the treasures.

👁️‍🗨️ **One player is the *Hunter***:  
→ Uses the **mouse** to aim and shoot at the possessed object.

👥​ **The other player is the *Impostor***:  
→ Uses the **keyboard** to move stealthily among the other objects.

The game alternates between **two phases**, each lasting 10 seconds:

### 🌞 Day (10s)

- The Hunter can **fire ONE shot** at any object suspected to be the Impostor.
- ✅ If correct → **Victory!**
- ❌ If wrong → The object is destroyed and the round ends.

⚠️ **The Impostor must not move during the day**, or risk being exposed.

---

### 🌑 Night (10s)

- The screen goes **completely dark**:
→ The Impostor can move **freely and unseen**.
→ They can change hiding spots to confuse the Hunter. 🕶️

🏆​ The impostor wins if the counter reaches 100

## 🕹️ How to Play
